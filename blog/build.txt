The proxyStore thatâ€™s being passed into them allows you to directly manipulate the cache with the changes you expect to happen through this mutation.

optimisticUpdater is triggered right after the mutation is sent (before the server response comes back) - it allows you to implement the success scenario of the mutation so that the user sees the effect of her mutation right away without having to wait for the server response.

updater is triggered when the actual server response comes back. If optimisticUpdater is implemented, then any changes that were introduced through it will be rolled back before updater is executed.
